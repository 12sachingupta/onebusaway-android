# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

###I did a backup via "Settings->Save to storage" - where is it located on my SD card?**

 You might need to do a little hunting to find the backup using a File Manager app, or connect the device to your computer and browse the folder structure.  It should be under the folder `OBA Backups`, with the file name `db.backup`.  This could be on the SD card on your device, or on internal storage on your device, depending on your Android version and device manufacturer (it's complicated).

 Note that you'll need to put it in the same folder on a new device to be able to "Restore backup" in the app.
