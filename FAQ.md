# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

###I did a backup via "Settings->Save to storage" - where is it located on my SD card?

 You might need to do a little hunting to find the backup using a File Manager app, or connect the device to your computer and browse the folder structure.  It should be under the folder `OBA Backups`, with the file name `db.backup`.  This could be on the SD card on your device, or on internal storage on your device, depending on your Android version and device manufacturer (it's complicated).

 Note that you'll need to put it in the same folder on a new device to be able to "Restore backup" in the app.

###The blue dot on the map for my location isn't accurate - it's a few blocks away from my real position

Location information comes directly from your mobile device.  The best way to try and fix this is to go to your Android system settings and then "Location,", and make sure that "Mode" is set to "High accuracy (GPS and networks)".  After checking/changing this, you might also want to turn your device off and back on again.
