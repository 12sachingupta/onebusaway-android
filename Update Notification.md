If you're receiving "updating reminders" notifications from the OneBusAway app and cannot find a specific setting within the app to disable them, you might want to try the following steps:

Check Notification Channels: Since you mentioned looking into the Android notification manager, make sure to check the notification channels for the OneBusAway app specifically. Sometimes apps organize their notifications into different channels, and you might find the option to disable certain types of notifications there.

System Settings: In addition to the app's settings, check your device's system settings for notification management. On Android, you can usually access notification settings by going to Settings > Apps & notifications > Notifications. Look for the OneBusAway app in the list of installed apps and see if there are any options to customize its notifications.

Update the App: Make sure you're using the latest version of the OneBusAway app. Developers often address user feedback and issues like unwanted notifications in updates, so updating the app might resolve the problem.

Contact Support: If you've exhausted all other options and are still unable to disable the notifications, consider reaching out to the app developer's support team for assistance. They may be able to provide guidance or offer a solution to your problem.
