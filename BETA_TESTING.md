# Beta Testing OneBusAway Android

We provide early access to new versions of OneBusAway Android via Google Play's [beta testing](https://developer.android.com/distribute/googleplay/developer-console.html#alpha-beta) platform.  This helps us get feedback on bug fixes and new features before they are distributed to all users.

Please note that these versions are not as heavily tested as production releases and, as a result, may not be as stable.

## Register as a beta tester

1. Join the [onebusaway-developers Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/onebusaway-developers) using a Google account
2. Go to https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.joulespersecond.seattlebusbot and opt in for testing (using the same Google account)
3. Download the app from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joulespersecond.seattlebusbot) (using the same Google account) - you'll now have access to the beta version!

You only have to complete the above steps once.  Unless you opt-out (using the same link in #2 above), you'll continue to receive new beta versions as they are released.

Please note that you need to use the same Google account for all three steps above, or you won't get access to the beta.
